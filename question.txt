Good evenning, Fellow Toastmasters and guests, Toastmasters wants to challenge members to develop your impromptu communications skills, 
to effectively “think on their feet” by answering unrehearsed questions. 
I also want to give every member the opportunity to speak at each meeting. So we have have Table Topics.

Table Topics is specifically designed to develop four essential communications skills:
Listening
Thinking
Organizing
Speaking

SO leverag this opportunity

Today I will be asking questions about Tech-driven language learning.

Your response must be at least one (1) minute, and can be no more than two (2) minutes and thirty (30) seconds. 
You will see a Green signal after 1 minute (your minimum time), a Yellow signal at 1:30, and a Red signal at two (2) minutes. 
Those who speak within time qualify for a “Best Table Topics” award.

(Add optional club rules, as: “You also must use the Word of the Day to qualify.”)

As I conduct the Table Topics, I will ask the question first, and then I will call on someone to respond. 
This way everybody listens and everyone starts thinking of a response. Remember, you should give your answer in ONE to TWO Minutes. 
You can think of an answer before beginning, and you do not need to tell the truth.


Repeat each question. Lead the applause. Give each person a different question. Keep notes on who participates and what question is asked.

After the last speaker: Mr./Madam Timekeeper, can I have the report for each speaker, and who qualifies for the “Best Table Topics” award?

After the Timer reports on all times, BRIEFLY summarize by giving their names and what question each answered or what they said.
